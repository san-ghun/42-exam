Write a program that finds all possible subsets of a given array of integers whose elements sum up to a specified target value.

More formally, the problem could have been stated as:

Given an array of integers and a target sum, write a program that:

- Finds all possible combinations of numbers from the input array
- Prints only those combinations whose sum equals the target value
- Takes input as command line arguments where:
  - First argument is the target sum
  - Remaining arguments are the array elements
- Prints each valid combination on a new line"

This is a variation of the "Subset Sum Problem", but instead of finding just one solution or determining if a solution exists, it finds and prints all possible solutions.

Sample Problem Scenario:

```
Input: Target = 10, Array = [1,2,3,4,5]
Expected Output: All subsets of these numbers that sum to 10
(e.g., "1 4 5" and "2 3 5" would be valid outputs)
```
