# 42-exam

I am `sanghupa`, a student at 42Berlin. This repository is a code base where I store my learnings, including my approachs to exercises and implemented practices.

I store commonly used data structure and algorithms, such as swap and sort, in `/common` and exercises in each category of levels. For each exercises, I try several approachs case by case.

> Solutions stored in this repository are NOT TESTED on exam and might NOT suit with 42Berlin's regulatory in exam. These are just logs or results of my learning.
